Scenario Description: 
We created this data model to serve as a real estate customer relationship management system. It tracks all the interactions that happens betweens customers, sales representatives, and properties. The database that we created helps to manage things such as a customer lead, the showings of properties, any offers, contracts, or payments, as well as commission. It is aimed at real estate agencies, which helps them to streamline sales with customers.
